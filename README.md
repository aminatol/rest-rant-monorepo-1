# Project REST-Rant
REST-Rant is an app where users can review restaurants.

### Setup
First, you'll need a Postgres database to connect to. Follow instructions here to setup the database and save credentials for the next step.

Next create a `.env` file inside of `backend`. It will need to contain the following environment variables (change the values for the database to match what you defined in the previous step)
```
PORT=5000
DB_USERNAME=rest_rant_user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=rest_rant
```

Next `cd` into `backend` and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the API.

Next, `cd` into `frontend`, and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the React app.

Finally, in separate terminals, run `npm start` in each folder so that the API and React app are running at the same time.
